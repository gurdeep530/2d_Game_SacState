🚁 Firefighting Helicopter Game
A single-player helicopter simulation game developed as a college project using Java and Codename One. The objective is simple but urgent: save buildings by extinguishing fires before your fuel runs out!

🕹️ Game Objective
You pilot a helicopter tasked with putting out fires that break out in buildings across the map. Navigate to the river to collect water and drop it over fire zones marked by pink circles. If you run out of fuel before putting out all the fires, the mission fails.

🧠 Key Feature: AI Helicopter Support
One of the most exciting aspects of this game is the AI helicopter system. When a player clicks on a fire, the AI helicopter will:

Find the shortest route to the river

Collect water

Fly to the selected fire

Automatically extinguish it

This brings an additional layer of strategy and interaction to the gameplay.

🎮 How to Play
Use the arrow keys or touch input to control your helicopter.

Hover over the river to fill up your water tank.

Fly over the pink fire circles and dump water to put out the fires.

Watch your fuel gauge — running out of fuel means game over!

Click on a fire to assign it to the AI helicopter.

✅ Win Condition
Extinguish all the fires before your fuel runs out.

❌ Lose Condition
Your helicopter runs out of fuel before all fires are extinguished.
